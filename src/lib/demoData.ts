  originalQuestion: DEMO_ORIGINAL_QUESTION,
  theAnswer:
    `Knowledge workers are not debating whether to use AI — they're using it daily and renegotiating who they are because of it. The shift is from execution to judgment: PMs feel "promoted without changing jobs," designers say "I provide the taste," writers move "from writing to editing." Underneath the productivity gains, every participant is privately working through the same three questions: am I losing skills, how do I act around colleagues who use it differently, and what part of this work is still mine.`,

      answer:
        `AI is now woven into daily work, not reserved for special projects. Sarah used Claude across a 200-feedback synthesis and product spec ("3-4 days became 8 hours"). Marcus generated 100 visual directions in an hour for ideation. Priya gets first drafts in minutes from research + style guide. The pattern: AI compresses production time, and the human time gets reallocated to judgment and editing.`,

      question: 'How has your daily work routine changed since you started using AI assistants?',
      answer:
        `The work hasn't sped up so much as restructured. Routine processing (tickets, summaries, drafts, sketches) collapsed; strategic and editorial time expanded. All three describe a shift from doing the work to directing it.

      answer:
